Issues: 
1. The storing of image should be implemented as serialize method


-------

meta-data that is missing: 
1. number of shares and quorum?
2. keys? 
3. fix matrix? 


IDA : 
,
1. make the n-shares and k configurable


Streaming support

matrix = n X k 
input = k x L 
out = n x L 

we can do the dot product for col1 (first byte of output files) and 
n rows (to get first byte of n files and then col2 and n rows to get 2nd byte of 
n files, etc... in this case, we don't need to wait for all the data before writing
out.. 
So, the algo will be everytime we get k bytes of data, we write out to n files immediately. 



--- extra meta info ---
matrix={(1,2,3,4},{2,3,4,5),....}
shares=4
quorum=3
